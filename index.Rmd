I am a postdoctoral researcher in the University of Konstanz. My interest is in using database analysis and computer simulations to answer questions in community ecology and macroecology. Currently I mainly combine the [Global Naturalized Alien Flora database](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) with other excellent databases to explore these topics. 

I graduated with a BS in Marine Biological Resource and a MS in Freshwater Biology. Afterwards, I began working as a lab assistant and then a PhD candidate with [Dr. Ian Donohue](https://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/research/groups/donohue/) and [Dr. Andrew L Jackson](http://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/research/groups/jackson/) in [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/), where I investigated the multidimensionality of ecological stability. In June 2018, I joined the [Ecology Lab](https://www.biologie.uni-konstanz.de/kleunen/) as a postdoc working with Prof. Mark van Kleunen.
